*DESCRIPTION*: A basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) was successfully designed to perform fundamental arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU was developed using Verilog HDL. 
It supports the operations Addition, Subtraction, AND, OR and NOT. A comprehensive testbench was written to simulate and verify the ALU's functionality. Simulation was performed using Xilinx Vivado. Waveforms were analyzed to ensure Correct output results and Proper switching between operations. All operations produced expected outputs with no functional errors. The ALU was verified to be functionally correct and stable. The basic ALU design is complete, verified through simulation, and meets all the required functional specifications.
